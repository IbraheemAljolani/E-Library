# E-Library
E-LibraryAPI is a RESTful API that provides access to a database called E-Library, designed to handle the storage needs of a fictional library. The database contains information about books, authors, publishers, and borrowers.

The API is built using the ASP.NET Core framework and C#,  The API currently features a Books Controller, which handles the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of books in the database.

Note that this API is still in development, and more endpoints and controllers may be added in the future to provide additional functionality and support for other features of the ELibraryDB database.
